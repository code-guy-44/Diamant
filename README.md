### The "push-your-luck" game

##
You are exploring a temple trying to find as much treasure as you can. But there are many hazards in the temple that may force you to escape and leave your gathered treasure s behind.
The game consists of a deck of cards. There are 15 treasure cards valued 1 through 15. There are also 15 hazard cards, 3 cards each of 5 different types: Snakes, Spiders, Falling Rocks, Lava, and Zombies. The object of the game is to leave the temple with as much treasure as possible without revealing two copies of the same hazard.
To start the game, shuffle the treasure cards and the hazard cards together to form a deck of 30 cards, and then reveal the top card. If it is a treasure card, add its value to the currently accumulated treasure. If it is a hazard card, do nothing. The player then has a choice of whether to leave the temple and keep their accumulated treasure, or to continue exploring.
If the player continues, another card is revealed. If the revealed card is a second copy of a hazard that has already been revealed, the player loses and the game is over. Otherw ise, if the revealed card is a treasure, add its value to the accumulated treasure value. If instead the card is the first copy of a hazard card to be revealed, nothing happens. Either way, the player again has a choice of whether to continue exploring or to leave the temple.
This cycle of revealing cards and making decisions continues until either the players loses by revealing a second copy of a hazard card, or they decide to leave the temple. If the player decides to leave the temple, the player wins and their score is the accumulated value of the treasures they have revealed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
